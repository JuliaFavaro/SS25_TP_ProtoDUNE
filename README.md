# Julia Favaro's Project - CERN Summer Student 2025, Neutrino group
  -title
  
This project will focus on comparing sensitivity thresholds, noise characteristics, detector response, and background rates between real and simulated ProtoDUNE data, focusing particularly on Argon-39.

### Usage
Python  (Conda) environment to run the notebooks. We used the library Uproot to read, write and manipulate the ROOT files without installing ROOT itself.

Dataset kindly provvided by the 

#### Dependencies 
    - numpy - array and math functions
    - uproot - for manipulating ROOT TTrees
    - awkward- for working with ragged arrays
    - scipy - numerical methods 
    - matplotlib- plotting
    - iminuit- for fitting by optimization
    - ipython, jupyter and jupyterlab- interactive analysis
    - pandas- for working with datasets structures

### Authors and acknowledgment
Julia Favaro's bio: I'm a master student from the University of Pisa (Italy). I am currently pursuing a career in astroparticle physics and data analysis. In July and August 2024, I worket at the CERN's  Summer Student Program, as summer student in the Neutrino group, particularly on Proto-DUNE.

Supervisors: Dr. Klaudia Wawroska, Alessandro Thea, Giovanna Lehmann Miotto (EP-DUNE Department). 
  
### Project status
My summer student program finishes on 22.08.2025.
